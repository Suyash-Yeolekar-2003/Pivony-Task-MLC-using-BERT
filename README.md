# Multi-label Text Classification using BERT

### Project Overview
This project uses **BERT** to classify research papers into multiple categories based on their titles and abstracts. It handles multi-label classification and evaluates the model using standard metrics such as accuracy, precision, recall, and F1-score.

---

## Dataset
The dataset contains research papers with `title`, `summary`, and `terms` (categories). You can download it from [your dataset source] or use your own.

---

## Evaluation
The model is evaluated using metrics such as **accuracy**, **precision**, **recall**, and **F1-score**.

**Accuracy: 0.41062288749396425
Precision: 0.8701328447091159
Recall: 0.5439056981960485
F1-Score: 0.6693879948314342**

## Future Work
Future improvements include:
- Implement **Reinforcement Learning with Human Feedback (RLHF)**.
- Further fine-tuning and testing.
